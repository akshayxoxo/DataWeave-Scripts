# Get JSON object difference script

Place the script(in file : get-difference-json-objects.dwl) in any component where dw scripts are allowed(e.g. set variable,set payload,transform message).

The script takes data from two variables:

 - newData - The updated version of the variable to compare.
 - oldData - The original version of the variable to compare newData variable with.

> Make sure these variables are created and populated with  data before the execution of the script.
